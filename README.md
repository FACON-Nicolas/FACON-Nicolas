# Professional experiences

## Efficience Digitale

### Qobook

For Qobook, Iâ€™ve wrapped up the migration from Firebase to Supabase. This switch has helped structure the data more effectively while keeping key features like authentication and real-time notifications intact. With these final touches, the app is now smoother and more flexible for future growth.

### 365x

For 365fois, I completed a full reskin of the app, integrated notifications, and migrated React Native from version 0.66 to 0.72. The app was then successfully published on the stores, providing users with a more modern and enhanced experience.

# Hobbies

## Travelling

Iâ€™m passionate about traveling and exploring new cultures, learning languages directly while being immersed in the local environment. Iâ€™ve traveled to Ireland and Spain, where I had the opportunity to dive into the local cultures and sharpen my language skills. These enriching experiences help me understand the countries I visit more deeply and build stronger connections with their people.

## Tech

I enjoy working on my side projects during my free time, with the idea of eventually commercializing them. I'm also passionate about everything related to tech in general, constantly exploring new trends and technologies to enhance my skills and projects.
